Caveat: My recommendations for food are completely driven by my diet of vegetarian food. 


Restaurants


SOMA/Financial District/Chinatown/Tenderloin


* Frog Hollow Farm: The lunch salad is delicious! 
* Oasis Grill: Across the street from us on Drumm and Sacramento and has the best felafels hands down! Spicy? SAY YES! :) → definitely need the spicy sauce
* Henry’s Hunan on Sansome: They have great hunan food. I usually get the Kung Pao tofu and the veggie chow mein. 
* Mexico au Parc (South Park): Great burritos 
* Iron Cactus: Good burritos → healthy but not the best mexican food
* The Melt: Soup and grilled cheese sandwich. → great with tomato soup 
* Chaat Cafe: Get the biryani. Its not really authentic but still tastes good. Think Indian fried rice. If you can handle the heat tell them to make it spicy. 
* Local Pizza and kitchen: Wood fired pizza.
* Palomino (Embarcadero): Great pizza and on the
* Zero Zero: Ok Pizza. Its not as great as the original Picco in Larkspur - which is my favorite place for a good pie! 
* Amber: Same one as the Mountain View location - a bit more hip. Buffet is okay. A la carte is better. 
* Sai’s Vietnamese: Great coconut curry tofu, great veggie tofu, great crispy noodles topped with veggies and tofu. Standard vietnamese coffee. Excellent veggie rolls (non-deep fried ones). 
* Saigon Sandwich: The best vietnamese sandwich in the city. Tofu for veggies, grilled chicken for non-veggies. The fancy pork is also good afaik. 
* Chutneys SF: Great dal and rice. Oh I love it so much I lick my finger and bite them because I can’t get enough. But get it at night. In the day there are no Pakistani/Indian people to supervise the cooks so they mess up everything. The chicken breast and nihari is supposed to be good too. I like the mattar paneer as well. Get roti instead of naan if you feel you want healthier food. You have to tell them to add less oil and make it spicy. 
* Naan n’ curry: People love this place. I think chutneys is better. You decide. My wife oscillates between the two. I don’t think its as clean and the place is dark and depressing for my taste. 
* Shalimar: Opposite chutneys on Jones: the original! this place started the Indo-Pak cuisine trend. Oily like a frikkin oil tanker exploded in there or something :( 
* Borobudur: Indonesian. Went there last in 2007. Was telling Heena we must go again. And we went there again in December 2013 and the food was awesome and insanely spicy (which is good). 
* Emporio Ruilli: A coffee shop on Union Square. Great cappucino.
* Burger bar: In the macy’s on union square: Great views. okay burger. Did I say great views? 
* City view in chinatown for dim-sum - folks I know from HK love it. 
* Chef Hung: Its in the basement and has great broccoli tofu and egg foo yung. They also have very good fried rice and their singapore curry noodles are the BEST. 
* Chung King on Jackson st: Eggplant tofu here is great. 
* Jai Yun: This is our absolute favorite and we went there for our tenth wedding anniversary (with the kid!). Chef Nei is from China and does not speak english. You tell how much you want to spend for dinner (starts @ 100 per person - we have gone upto 130). Then the food comes for the next three hours. Presentation and taste is superb. He loves his art. Once he refused to take money because he felt he did not do a good job. We had to literally shove it into his hands. If you want to go veggie let me know. I will have our friend call him and explain to him. He knows my wife well  because she helped with his tax work. One of our absolute fav places in the world. 
* Osha Thai: A couple of branches around the city. The original is on 2nd st. Many people love it. There is one across the street in the embarcadero which I recommend. Lively atmosphere - sometimes loud music. In my opinion its American food with thai ingredients. 
* Veggie chinese
   * Lucky creation vegetarian: In Chinatown and the first veggie place I went to. Still have fond memories but have not gone back in ages :(. They have veggie pork buns and the crispy noodles with gluten puff is good. 
   * Enjoy Vegetarian: A few around the city. My fav is the one in Chinatown. Get the basil chicken, tofu salad thingy, mustard green soup w/crispy noodles, salty fish fried rice, singapore style noodles, sea bass thingy ( I’ll have to look up the menu, but given that its close to 11 pm and I’ve not had dinner yet, I’m skipping doing that ). Also they do a mean dry tofu dish which is delicious. Don’t forget to get BBQ pork appetizer which is awesome too IMHO. 
   * Golden Era: Went there once and it was very good. 
* Greens and Millenium: They are loved. Unfortunately we’ve not had a chance to go there. SHAME ON ME. Veggie and did not go there. BOOOOO :( 
* Rose Pistola: Great Italian. My wife simply loved it. 
* Gary Danko’s: Expensive. Fancy shmancy. I’m going to go there soon so will tell you how it is. 
* Eddie Rickenbackers: This is a cool place with really old-school motorbikes inside hanging off the ceiling and the wall. Great salads and the veggie burger is AWESOME. 
* Plant Cafe: Make a reservation for a seat with a water view. The veggie burgers here are super awesome. AFAIK the pizza is decent too (but there are better places to get pizza). 
* Philz coffee: Unusual coffee bar (a bunch around the city) - they “customize the coffee” based on what you like. - Mint Mojito 
* 21A: Love the veggie burger here. Its a bar however. More like a microbrewery. Not an Irish pub. 
* Super Duper Veggie Burger - amazing!
* Toaster Oven: Good veggie bell sandwich
* Zogs dogs: Good hot dogs - CLOSED WTF! :(   I have to find a new good hot dog place. There is one on Fremont and Mission but I’ve not tried it
* Julie’s kitchen: Food by the pound. Be careful else you’ll end up paying 15-20 bucks a meal :) 


The Richmond/Filmore/Marina
* Dosa on Filmore: Mmmmmmmmm Dosa :) - Went to Dosa on Valencia kind of expensive
* SIchuan Home on Geary: Good Sichuan food. We get: Japanese broccoli and Tofu, Kung Pao tofu, Veggie fried rice (which is very good)

* Genki Ramen on Clement: Nutella Crepes
* Tanuki sushi on California (one of our Sunday night Sushi places). 
* Chin Sushi bar (one of our Sunday night Sushi places) 
* Burma Mandalay on California: Get the tea salad. 
* Burma Superstar: Yellow bean tofu is good. Their burmese curries are good. Go early (5:30 pm) else you have to wait like an hour or more. 
* B-Star: Sister restaurant to Burma Superstar, a bit more fusion-y. We go there for lunch dates
* King of Thai Noodle house on Clement (between 7th and 8th - there is another one on the same street too but this is the original): Hole in the wall - really. Excellent Pad see ew and cashew nut tofu. Good Panang curry. Good eggplant tofu. 
* Thai Time off clement on 8th Ave: Great thai curries and veggie dishes. They have Khao Suey noodle soup - Its not as good as the one I had in Chiang Mai, but beggars can’t be choosers so I still lick the bowl. 
* Little Chihuahua: Good burritos (our mexican friends say they’re the best). Quality is high. 
* Herbivore: Great veggie place. Good pizza! Asian food, not so much. Mock meat kababs. 
* Jays Cheesesteak: Excellent seitan cheesesteak. We get the teriyaki or garlic ones. My mom loves bbq flavor and gets those. 
* Papalote: Excellent veggie and soyrizzo burritos - get them super. Good horchata. 
* The picnic at the presidio: Sunday 11 am to 2 pm: In the presidio there are tonnes of food trucks, music, wine and the park is open with lots of families and a nice ocean view! 
* Barney’s burgers: I had to eat it with a fork and knife they are that big! Good :) 
* Assab eritrean food: Love the shiro with injera.
* Nizario’s pizza: Now this one is a bit of an oddball. All the American’s think its so-so pizza. My mom and Heena’s family eat a pizza EVERYDAY from there when they are in the US because they love it. My mom will eat a slice each day. Heena’s bro and his kids ask about it each time we talk to them. They love it that much. I love it too. But I love Pizza in general :)
* Giorgio’s pizza: Our family pizza place to go. Very family friendly. Offers thin and extra thin crust and whole wheat! Ask for less tomato sauce else it gets too soggyish. 
* Pizza Orgasmica: Good pizza. 
* Khan Toke: This is a beautiful Thai restaurant. The food is good. As in its different from the normal Thai fare you’ve had. Get the corn cakes. They are delicious. This one time we were a group of 14 people and we ordered so many that they ran out (or refused to serve us any more - haha). But its a beautiful house - the tables are low-rise so you have to put your feet into the ground. Do this when you finish the hike from 14th ave to GGB to 25th Ave. Totally worth 1 evening I say. 
* Roam Burgers on Filmore: Oh the veggie burger here is to TO DIE FOR. 
Mission
* Rhea’s Deli: GREAT sandwiches: Veggie BBQ Chicken (fake meat) sandwich IS THE BEST SANDWICH I HAVE HAD IN THE WORLD. Yes I am screaming. For meat eaters the chicken or pork katsu. Also its named after my daughter. So has to be like.. .frikkin awesome :) When I die I will swim in the ocean of these sandwiches and eat unlimited amounts…

* The fizzery: The place I was telling you about - sodas! 
* (Castro): Ike’s place - sandwiches. Make sure you get Ike’s dirty sauce on the sandwich.
